# Attendance Management System

This is a PHP-based Attendance Management System that runs offline using the XAMPP control panel. It allows administrators to manage students, record attendance, view visual reports, and export data. The system is secure, admin-restricted, and simple to use, making it ideal for schools, training centers, and offices.

- 👁️‍🗨️ **Role-based Access**: Only admins can view student contact info; others see restricted views.
